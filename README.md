### Group Project
#### Hangman Aqua
Hangman Aqua if a graphic-based game that puts a twist on the classic hangman game. Instead of adding on body parts as a consequence for guessing a letter wrong, the hangman image is static and there will be water that rises. If you guess a letter correctly, that lettter will appear on the black lines that indicate how many letters there are in the word. After 5 times of getting a letter wrong, the game will end. Have fun and good luck!

#### Number Guessing Game (Python)
This Number Guessing Game is an interactive python game that requires the user to enter a number from 1-100. The computer will automatically generate a random digit and the goal is for the user to guess that random digit. With every guess, the game will also tell you if the guess was too high or too low or just correct. Then, you can guess again.
