### Group Project

#### Hangman Aqua
Hangman Aqua if a graphic-based game that puts a twist on the classic hangman game. Instead of adding on body parts as a consequence for guessing a letter wrong, the hangman image is static and there will be water that rises. If you guess a letter correctly, that lettter will appear on the black lines that indicate how many letters there are in the word. After 5 times of getting a letter wrong, the game will end. Have fun and good luck!
